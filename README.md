# AlarmClock
Alarm Clock using python pygame
In this mini project we are trying to make an alarm clock using pygame. We can set an alarm by typing the
hour minutes and seconds on the text field. There are two buttons, one for setting the alarm and the other
is for off the alarm if we change our mind. We have to download a tone for the alarm and give the link to
play that tone when the alarm go off. It will also print Wake Up when the alarm go off.
